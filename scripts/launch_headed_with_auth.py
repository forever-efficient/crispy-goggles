"""Helper to launch a headed Chromium with auth_state.json for local observation.

This runs in a separate process to avoid asyncio / sync API conflicts when
pytest's event loop is active. It opens a browser, navigates to x.com using
the provided storage-state, waits briefly so the developer can observe, then
closes.
