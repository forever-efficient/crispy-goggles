Remove requirements.txt and consolidate dependencies in pyproject.toml

Removed the repository-level `requirements.txt` and updated docs, scripts, and CI to use
`pyproject.toml` for dependency management. Updated Playwright cache keys in workflows to
hash `pyproject.toml`, changed `scripts/setup.sh` to install the project in editable mode
with dev extras, and added a short Quick setup and FAQ to README. Also updated the
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `setup.cfg` accordingly.

This simplifies onboarding and keeps packaging aligned between local development and CI.
